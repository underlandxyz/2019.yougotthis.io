  <h1 class="title">Inclusion Programme</h1>
  <p>We're committed to running an accessible, inclusive and safe conference for everyone. We're working with <a href="http://mykindof.tech/">my Kind of Tech</a> to add extra ✨ to our inclusion programme. To make this an event for everyone, we will do the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <h3>Conduct</h3>
    <li>Having a <a href="/conduct">Code of Conduct</a> which will be enforced.</li>
    <li>Ensuring all of our team members (including volunteers) are trained in incident response to swift resolve matters in a kind and caring way.</li>
    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
    <li>The venue we book will have wheelchair accessibility.</li>
    <li>We will have live transcriptions for those who are hard of hearing, with transcripts available after the event.</li>
    <h3>Cost</h3>
    <li>Early bird tickets will cost just £50, with general availability tickets costing £75. This is a very low price point compared to many other conferences. Food and refreshments will be included in this cost.</li>
    <li>We will facilitate free tickets to those who cannot afford the ticket cost. This will be mainly funded by an optional donation on ticket purchase, and supplemented by Underland.</li>
    <h3>Speakers</h3>
    <li>Speakers will be offered 1-on-1 advice and mentorship if they are first-time speakers or want to otherwise build confidence.</li>
    <li>Speakers will receive payment of £300 to cover their travel and accommodation. We hope this will encourage those who are concerned by the cost of participation to still submit a proposal.</li>
    <li>Part of our speaker requirements will be a "content warning" slide at the start of each talk, with time to leave if attendees want to.</li>
    <h3>Other bits</h3>
    <li>All-Vegan menu by default.</li>
    <li>Committed to a diverse speaker lineup.</li>
    <li>Small fund available to cover childcare costs for attendees.</li>
    <li>Ensuring availability of gender-neutral facilities, aiming to not have gendered facilities at all.</li>
    <li>Working towards having a quiet breakout space for those who need to cool off from the social activity.</li>
    <li>A dedicated team member to support any attendees with accessibility requirements.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The Underland and My Kind of Team teams hope this will make the event comfortable for everyone. If there's something more you think we could be doing, please <a href="mailto:yougotthis@underland.xyz">get in touch</a>.</p>
