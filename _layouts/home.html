  <h2>You Got This will cover topics across three themes - learning, living and levelling-up. This isnâ€™t your typical tech conference - we're not talking about your technical skills, but everything else needed for a happy, healthy work life.</h2>
  <p>You Got This is an annual, 150+ person conference for junior developers, designers, and their teams to learn how to better support their co-workers. Submit your talk by September 9 2018, and tickets will be available soon after.</p>
