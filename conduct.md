We believe that everyone has the right to be in a safe and welcoming environment when attending You Got This. This Code of Conduct is about creating an open and welcoming environment at out event so that all our attendees feel able to participate while being safe and happy. 

People can have lots of viewpoints, and being part of this event means: 

* Committing to helping each other
* Listening to others views
* Setting an example
* Treating everyone equally
* Respecting your environment and the people around you

To represent yourself to your very best ability, you must always practice:

* No violence
* No harassment
* No discrimination
* No inappropriate imagery or content

Harassment includes but is not limited to offensive verbal or written comments related to gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. **If what youâ€™re doing is making someone feel uncomfortable, that counts as harassment and is enough reason to stop doing it.**

Attendees asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately. 

Absolutely **everyone** involved with our activities, including participants, members, sponsors, guests, volunteers, organisers, and our committee members, are subject to our Code of Conduct. 

If a person engages in any harassing behaviour, we may take any action we deem appropriate, including (but not limited to) warnings, expulsion, and banning, with no eligibility for reimbursement or refund of any type. 

If you are being harassed, or notice someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact the You Got This care team using any of the following details:

* Phone number TBC closer to the event

We expect people to follow these rules at all event venues should there be more than one.
