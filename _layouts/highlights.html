    <p>You Got This 2019 took part on January 19th 2019 at the Monzo office in London. We had 195 people turn up - a mix of junior developers and those looking to how they can better support their team members. Thanks to sponsors and those who paid over the recommended ticket price - we were able to offer 97 scholarships to You Got This, including 8 which included travel, accommodation, childcare and a stipend to make participation cost-neutral. Our event retrospective is <a href="https://medium.com/underland/you-got-this-2019-retrospective-6dfadcad6ade">here</a>.</p>

        <h3>Perfectionism, Impostor Syndrome and Anxiety</h3>
        <p>Working in the tech industry can sometimes make us feel inferior. It is easy to start believing that everyone knows more, or finds the work easier. When weâ€™re surrounded by so many clever people, how can we not start to judge ourselves against them and our work against theirs?</p>
        <p>Impostor syndrome - the belief that you donâ€™t deserve to be where you are, and perfectionism - a need to work to impossibly high standards, are exhausting.</p>
        <p>Learn how to spot these destructive thought patterns in yourself, how to manage anxiety and procrastination and how to start being kinder to yourself, because youâ€™re awesome and you deserve to be here.</p>

        <h3>You know nothing... or do you?</h3>
        <p>Each and every day we encounter the knowledge of thousands of people. We read articles, blog posts, documentation and smart answers on StackOverflow. How can we compete against this well of wisdom?</p>
        <p>You might think that you have nothing to add. You'll be surprised how much you actually know.</p>

        <h3>Where did all my money go?</h3>
        <p>Six months after starting my first developer job I looked at my bank account and wondered, "Where did all my money go?"</p>
        <p>From a book by a Buddhist financial planner to swapping budgeting app recommendations with my best friend, this is my story of building a healthy relationship with money.</p>

        <h3>Junior.next()</h3>
        <p>Life as a "junior" developer can be intense, overwhelming, but rewarding. How can juniors move on to the next level? And, what can employers, mentors, and communities do to support the next generation of developers?</p>

        <h3>Self-care: Beyond the Hashtags</h3>
        <p>#Selfcare has over 7.5 million Instagram posts, but we have more questions than ever about what self-care actually is. In this talk, we'll take self-care beyond the hashtags and into your daily life. We'll define it and walk through the process of creating meaningful self-care rituals.</p>

        <h3>Morality and Ethics - Caring is Everything</h3>
        <p>In software development, caring is everything - and as the senior developers of tomorrow, we are should start the revolution.</p>
        <p>Are we the fix in the fight against guns-for-hire developers? How do we prevent unethical technology spreading (and being made)?</p>

        <h3>Understanding and Cultivating Independence</h3>
        <p>Independence is the key to professional growth. It doesnâ€™t mean working alone; it means being able to problem-solve and seek help. Attendees will leave with a new definition of independence, as well as a framework for developing and maintaining independence in their professional life.</p>

        <h3>The transformative power of junior developers</h3>
        <p>How do you help junior developers succeed? How do you maintain your teamâ€™s productivity while building a culture of learning?</p>
        <p>Borrowing from interactions with hundreds of companies successfully integrating their first junior team members â€“ companies like the FT, Telegraph, Deloitte, Tesco, and Santander â€“ this 30-minute talk will give an overview of what works, and what doesnâ€™t. Weâ€™ll focus on practical, easy-to-implement insights which will not only help you support your new developersâ€™ success and growth, but enhance your teamâ€™s progress as a whole, making it a more fun and productive place to work.</p>
